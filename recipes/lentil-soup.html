    <h1>Lentil Soup</h1>

   <p><h3>Description</h3></p>
   <p>Start your year and your meal with a delicious lentil soup.  Romans gave leather bags of legumes to their friends with the hope they would turn to gold.  Maybe they thought their friends were Rumpelstiltskin?</p>
   <p>This recipe is a Turkish-style lentil soup (mercimek Ã§orbasi). We can still keep our fingers crossed that you end with a bag of gold coins.</p>
   <p>The preparation for this soup is quick and easy.  I find letting it sit and simmer for a long time adds to its richness and flavor, but it's not necessary. It is also much easier to make with an immersion blender, but any food processor will do.</p>
   <p> <h3>Ingredients</h3></p>
   <p>Lentil Soup is very forgiving, so play around with the quantities in the recipe to make it your own.</p>
   <p><ul>
       <li>1 cup of dry red lentils (green lentils can be substituted if you cannot find the red)</li>
       <li>3 cups of broth or water</li>
       <li>1 large carrot, peeled and diced</li>
       <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
       <li>olive oil to saute onion and carrots (apprx 1/2 Tbs)</li>
       <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
       <li>1/4 tsp pepper</li>
       <li>1 Tbsp cumin</li>
       <li>fresh squeezed lemon juice and/or lemon wedges</li>
       <li>additional salt, pepper, and cumin to taste</li>
   </ul></p>
   <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
   <p><ol>
       <li>Rinse the lentils and set aside.  You can soak them in cold water ahead of of time if you want to reduce the cooking time</li>
       <li>In a large pot, saute carrot and onion in oil until soft</li>
       <li>Stir in salt, pepper, and cumin.</li>
       <li>Add lentils and broth and bring to a boil.</li>
       <li>Cover and reduce to a simmer.</li>
       <li>Simmer for at least 20 minutes or until the lentils are soft.</li>
       <li>Remove from heat and use immersion blender to blend until smooth.  How long you blend is up to personal preference for texture and thickness.</li>
       <li>Season to taste.</li>
       <li>Serve with fresh squeezed lemon juice or lemon wedges to taste.</li>
   </ol></p>
